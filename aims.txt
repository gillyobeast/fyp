"The principle objective of this project is to understand the definition of a C*-algebra and the proof of this remarkable theorem about commutative C*-algebras."
The aims for this project are to:
 Give a good background understanding on C*-algebra, including topological and geometric interpretation of results where possible.
 Consider the representation theory of C*-algebras, using the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction as a starting point.
 Consider the commutative and general versions of the Gelfand-Naimark theorem, and understand their contents and proof.
