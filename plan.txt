PLAN: (TO REORDER)
	-brief history (including motivation)
	-defn - talk about abstract defn vs practical uses i.e. operator algebras
	-prerequisite knowledge - i.e. references to sources for extra background and such
	-state aims of project
	-further/recent research - explore where this theory could lead

prerequisite knowledge:
	-algebras
	-normed spaces, ip spaces, hilbert spaces, linear algebra
	-topology - weak-* topology?
	-spectral theory
	-[simmons83] gives a good broad background on all of these
	-[blackadar06] gives a very fast, encyclopaedic coverage of lots of operator theory
	
AIMS:
The aims for my project are, provisionally:
	-Take the Gelfand-Naimark theorem, and understand its contents and proof.
	-Consider the representation theory of C*-algebras, using the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction as a starting point.



further research: e.g., 
	-group algebras - representation theory links,
	-k-theory and cuntz algebras, 
	-c* alg valued metric spaces, 
	-bicommutant thm, 
	-abstract (noncommutative) harmonic analysis, 
	-factors (von neumann algebras).
