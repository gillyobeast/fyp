\section{Introduction}
\subsection{History of C$^\ast$-Algebras}
	The noncommutative nature of W. Heisenberg's work in \cite{heisenberg25} lead to Born and Jordan (find reference) developing the matrix mechanics required to concisely convey the new quantum mechanical model. 
	From 1930-1943, J. von Neumann, together with F. J. Murray, developed the theory of \emph{rings of operators} acting on a Hilbert space in \cite{vonneumann35}, \cite{vonneumann37}, \cite{vonneumann40}, \cite{vonneumann43}, in an attempt to establish a general framework for this matrix mechanics.
	These rings of operators are now considered part of the theory of \emph{von Neumann algebras}, a subsection of C$^\ast$-algebra theory.
	In \cite{gelfand43}, Gelfand and Naimark established an abstract characterisation of C$^\ast$-algebras, free from dependence on the operators acting on a Hilbert space.
	The Gelfand-Naimark, which we will be considering here at length, gives the link between these abstract C$^\ast$-algebras and the rings of operators previously studied.
	
	
\subsection{C$^\ast$-Algebras}
	A brief overview of what a C$^\ast$-algebra is.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[$\bullet$] banach space
	\item[$\bullet$] banach algebra
	\item[$\bullet$] *-algebra
	\item[$\bullet$] C* algebra
	\item[$\bullet$] representations
\end{enumerate}
\begin{defn}
A \emph{C$^\ast$-algebra} is a Banach algebra $(A, \| \cdot \|)$ with involution $\ast : A \to A$ with the condition that
\begin{align*}
	\|x ^\ast x\| = \|x\|^2 \mbox{ for all } x \in A.
\end{align*}
\end{defn}
 
This condition is known as the \emph{C$^\ast$ axiom}. The study of C$^\ast$-algebras started with the consideration of matrix mechanics by H

There are many statements of the theorem; this here comes from [ref].
\begin{thm*}[Gelfand-Naimark, Commutative]
	Every commutative, unital C*-algebra A is isometrically $\ast$-isomorphic to the algebra of continuous functions on the algebra of characters on A.

\end{thm*}
The theorem first appeared in [gelfand-naimark] in a form relating `normed rings' and a closed subrings of the set of bounded operators on a Hilbert space.


\subsection{Aims}
The aims for my project are, provisionally:
\begin{enumerate}

	\item[$\bullet$] Take the Gelfand-Naimark theorem, and understand its contents and proof.
	\item[$\bullet$] Consider the representation theory of C$^\ast$-algebras, using the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction as a starting point.
	\item[$\bullet$] (as 'further reading') Give an overview of areas in which operator algebra theory can be taken (for example, Cuntz algebras and operator K-theory, von Neumann algebras and Factors, abstract harmonic analysis).
\end{enumerate}
