	{\small The collection of bounded linear operators from a Hilbert space to 
	itself forms an algebra, complete with respect to the operator norm and 
	possessing an involution map taking an operator to its adjoint operator. These 
	operations interact in a very strong way, leading to a linking of the algebraic 
	and topological structures of such an operator algebra. These operator algebras 
	are the prototype for a $C^\ast$-algebra, which we define as a complete normed 
	algebra with an involution such that the involution and norm interact in the 
	same way as in an operator algebra. In this report, we define an abstract 
	$C^\ast$-algebra and discuss the standard examples -- operators on a Hilbert 
	space and continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space. We discuss some of 
	the algebraic and topological structure of these spaces and go on to prove the 
	Gelfand-Naimark theorems. The Gelfand-Naimark theorem says that all 
	$C^\ast$-algebras are the same as an operator algebra on some Hilbert space, 
	and the commutative Gelfand-Naimark theorem states that any commutative 
	$C^\ast$-algebra is the same as an algebra of continuous functions on some 
	compact Hausdorff space.}\par

\chapter{Introduction}
\section{History of the Study of Operator Algebras}
The study of $C^\ast$-algebras started with the study of rings of operators 
acting on a Hilbert space, which was introduced in the 1930s as a framework for 
John von Neumann's 1932 formulation of quantum mechanics in \cite{vonneumann32}. 
These rings of operators are now considered part of the theory of \emph{von 
Neumann algebras}, a subsection of $C^\ast$-algebra theory. 



{In 1943, Gelfand and Naimark \cite{gelfand43} established an abstract 
characterisation of $C^\ast$-algebras, free from dependence on the operators 
acting on a Hilbert space. The Gelfand-Naimark theorem, which we will be 
considering here at length, gives the link between these abstract 
$C^\ast$-algebras and the rings of operators previously studied. Used in the 
proof of the GN theorem is the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction, a technique 
which, given a certain linear function on a $C^\ast$-algebra, yields a 
representation of that $C^\ast$-algebra as an algebra of operators on a Hilbert 
space.} 

\section{Resources}
Throughout this work we will be making extensive use of (the first volume of) 
\emph{`Fundamentals of the Theory of Operator Algebras'} 
\cite{kadison83,kadison86}, by Kadison and Ringrose; the authors aim to make 
accessible the ``vast recent research literature'', by first introducing and 
exploring the prototypical examples and developing the abstract theory later. 

	
Some other texts which cover $C^\ast$-algebras: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item 	Dixmier \cite{dixmier77} presents a summary of the general theory up to 
	that time (1977), with \cite{dixmier81} focussing on reworking and developing 
	the theory of von Neumann algebras; 
	\item 	Sakai \cite{sakai71} gives a treatment of $C^\ast$- and von Neumann 
	algebras from a more topological point of view; 
	\item	Davidson \cite{davidson96} gives a quick overview of the theory and uses 
	that as a baseline to explore many classes of examples;
	\item 	Blackadar \cite{blackadar06} gives a concise, encyclopaedic coverage of 
	the theory of operator algebras, and covers more specialised material and 
	applications. 

\end{itemize}
	
\section{An Overview}

After this introductory chapter, we give some definitions and results which will 
be used throughout, and establish notation. Then the definition of a 
$C^\ast$-algebra is given, with some discussion of algebras with a 
multiplicative identity, followed by an exploration of an example with some 
previews of concepts later defined. 

We move on to discussing a powerful tool in 
this area, and indeed all of functional analysis, which is the concept of the 
spectrum of an element; then we make some more definitions and discuss how the 
topological and algebraic structures of $C^\ast$-algebras are related. 
We finish that chapter with another example, with a remark on what makes the 
study of abstract $C^\ast$-algebras applicable to quantum mechanics. 

The final chapter contains the statements and proofs of the Gelfand-Naimark 
theorems, and a discussion of how they relate to each other. The Gelfand-Naimark 
theorem for commutative $C^\ast$-algebras, discussed in Section 
\ref{section:abelian}, says that an Abelian $C^\ast$-algebra is in some way `the 
same as' the algebra of continuous complex valued functions on a compact, 
Hausdorff topological space. The Gelfand-Naimark theorem for general 
$C^\ast$-algebras, discussed in Section \ref{section:gn}, says that any 
$C^\ast$-algebra `the same as' the algebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert 
space.





\section{Further Topics}
Topics in $C^\ast$-algebra theory which follow on from this include the 
classification of different types of $C^\ast$-algebras, such as 
\emph{approximately-finite dimensional} $C^\ast$-algebras, which are made up in 
a certain way from finite dimensional $C^\ast$-algebras.


A \emph{von Neumann algebra }is a $C^\ast$-subalgebra of $\BH$ which is unital 
and closed in the \emph{weak operator topology}, the weakest topology such that 
the map $T\mapsto\langle Tx,y\rangle$ is continuous for all $x,y$ in $\H$. This 
enforces an even stricter structure on von Neumann algebras, giving results such 
as the von Neumann Double Commutant theorem.


Another area of research is $K$-theory, which for $C^\ast$-algebras refers to 
the study of groups related to the structure of projective elements. 

For more on all of these topics, see \cite{davidson96,dixmier81,sakai71}.

\chapter{Background Mathematics and Results} 
The following is some mathematics which may prove useful throughout the project, 
with relevant resources; we will of course be making definitions as needed.

	
We will be assuming some familiarity with the following theory:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Rings, algebras and linear spaces.
	\item Normed spaces, inner product spaces, Banach and Hilbert spaces.
	\item Point-set topology.
\end{itemize}
A good broad background on all of these can be found in \cite{rudin91,simmons83}.


	
	
The following notation applies throughout: $\mathbb{K}$ denotes a field. $\R^+$ 
denotes the non-negative reals. $\Real z$ refers to the real part of the complex 
number $z$. An ideal of an algebra is, unless otherwise stated, taken to mean a 
two-sided ideal. An algebra $A$ is \emph{commutative} or \emph{Abelian} if
\begin{align*}
	ab = ba \mbox{ for all } a,b\in A.
\end{align*}

\section{Linear Spaces}

A \emph{partial order} on a set $X$ is a relation $\leq$ which satisfies the conditions
\begin{itemize}
	\item $x \leq x$ for all $x$ in $X$; 		\hfill (reflexivity)
	\item for all $x$ and $y$ in $X$, if $x \leq y$ and $y\leq x$, then $x=y$; 
												\hfill (antisymmetry)
	\item for all $x,y$ and $z$ in $X$, if $x \leq y$ and $y\leq z$, then $x\leq z$. 
												\hfill (transitivity)
\end{itemize}

A \emph{positive cone} in a real vector space $V$ is a subset $V^+$ that is 
closed under addition and scaling by positive scalars, and if $v,-v$ are in 
$V^+$, then $v=0$. A \emph{partially ordered vector space} is a real vector 
space $V$ with a positive cone $V^+$ -- the partial order on $V$ given by
\begin{align*}
	x\leq y ~~\iff~~ y-x \in V^+,
\end{align*}
for $x,y$ in $V$.
A familiar example is the non-negative real numbers, which form a positive cone in $\R$.


Given a linear space $X$ over a field $\mathbb K$, a \emph{linear functional} on 
$X$ is a linear map $\rho:X\to\mathbb K$. The set $X^\ast$ of linear functionals 
on $X$ is itself a linear space, called the \emph{dual space} of $X$. A linear 
functional $\rho$ is called \emph{multiplicative} if $\rho(xy) = \rho(x)\rho(y)$ 
for all $x,y$ in $X$.


\begin{thm*}[Hahn-Banach Extension theorem] 
	If $\rho_0$ is a bounded linear functional on a subspace $X_0$ of a normed 
	linear space $X$,with dual space $X^\ast$ having norm $\left\|\cdot\right\|_\ast$, then 
	there is a bounded linear functional $\rho$ on $X$ such that 
 	$\left\|\rho\right\|_\ast=\left\|\rho_0\right\|_\ast$ and $\rho=\rho_0$ on $X_0$.
\end{thm*}
\begin{proof}
	Can be found in \cite[Theorem 1.6.1, p.~44]{kadison83}.
\end{proof}

\section{Hilbert Spaces}\label{section:hscons}
A normed linear space $(V,\left\|\cdot\right\|)$ is a \emph{Banach space} if it 
is complete with respect to $\left\|\cdot\right\|$, in the sense that all Cauchy 
sequences in $V$ converge with respect to the norm. An inner product space 
$(V,\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle)$ is a \emph{Hilbert space} if it is a Banach 
space with respect to the norm induced by $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle$.

A linear map, or a \emph{linear operator}, $T:\H\to\H$, from a Hilbert space to 
itself, is said to be \emph{bounded} if there exists a scalar $M$ such that 
\begin{align*}
	\left\|Tx\right\| \leq M \left\|x\right\|,
\end{align*}
for all $x$ in $\H$. Bounded linear operators are automatically continuous -- 
see \cite[1.32]{rudin91}. The collection $\BH$ of all bounded linear operators 
on a Hilbert space $\H$ is itself a Banach space with the operator norm 
\begin{align*}
	 \left\| T \right\| = \sup_{\|x\|=1} \left \|  Tx \right\|.
\end{align*}
We will discuss $\BH$ in more detail in Section \ref{section:bh}. 

We need some Hilbert space constructions -- particularly, the direct sum of a 
collection of Hilbert spaces and the direct sum of bounded operators on these 
Hilbert spaces. Given a finite collection $\left\{\H_1,\dots,\H_n\right\}$ of Hilbert 
spaces, let~$\H$ denote the set
\begin{align*}
	\H  = \left\{(x_1,\dots,x_n) \mid x_i \in \H_i \mbox { for } i=1,\dots,n \right\}.
\end{align*}
Define addition and scalar multiplication coordinatewise, and given 
$x=(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ and $y=(y_1,\dots,y_n) \in \H$, the equation
\begin{align*}
	\langle x,y\rangle = \langle x_1,y_1\rangle + \dots + \langle x_n,y_n \rangle
\end{align*}
defines an inner product $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle$ on $\H$. The resulting norm 
$\left\|\cdot\right\|$ is given by
\begin{align*}
	\left\|x\right\|^2 = \left\|x_1\right\|^2 + \dots + \left\|x_n\right\|^2.
\end{align*}
It is easy to show that $\H$ is a Hilbert space with these operations, and we 
call it the \emph{direct sum} of the collection 
$\left\{\H_1,\dots,\H_n\right\}$, denoted $\oplus\H_i$.

Similarly, we can construct a Hilbert space direct sum of an infinite collection 
$\left\{\H_i \mid i\in I\right\}$ of Hilbert spaces. Let $\H$ be the set
\begin{align*}
	\H= \Big\{(x_i) \mid x_i \in \H_i \mbox{ for each }i 
					\mbox{ and } \sum_{i\in I}{\left\|x_i\right\|^2} < \infty \Big\}.
\end{align*}

Given $x=(x_i)$ and $y=(y_i)\in\H$, we have that
\begin{align*}
			\Big(\sum_{i\in I}{\left\|x_i+y_i\right\|^2}\Big)^{1/2}
	&\leq	\Big(\sum_{i\in I}{(\left\|x_i\right\|+\left\|y_i\right\|)^2}\Big)^{1/2}	\\
	&\leq	\Big(\sum_{i\in I}{\left\|x_i\right\|^2}\Big)^{1/2}		+
						\Big(\sum_{i\in I}{\left\|y_i\right\|^2}\Big)^{1/2}				\\
	&< 		\infty.
\end{align*}
Hence, the sequence $(x_i+y_i)$ is in $\H$, and we can define addition and 
scalar multiplication coordinatewise on $\H$:
\begin{align*}
	(x_i)+(y_i)=(x_i+y_i) && \alpha(x_i) = (\alpha x_i).
\end{align*}

We also have
\begin{align*}
			\sum_{i\in I}{\left|\langle x,y\rangle\right|} 
	&\leq	\sum_{i\in I}{\left\|x_i\right\|	\left\|y_i\right\|}						\\
	&\leq 	\Big(\sum_{i\in I}{\left\|x_i\right\|^2}\Big)^{1/2}
							\Big(\sum_{i\in I}{\left\|y_i\right\|^2}\Big)^{1/2}			\\
	&< \infty,
\end{align*}
so that we can define an inner product $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle$, with induced 
norm $\left\|\cdot\right\|$, on $\H$ by
\begin{align*}
	\langle x,y\rangle = \sum_{i\in I}{\left|\langle x,y\rangle\right|}, 
			&& \left\|x\right\| = \Big(\sum_{i\in I}{\left\|x_i\right\|^2}\Big)^{1/2}.
\end{align*}

To see that $\H$ is complete with respect to $\left\|\cdot\right\|$, suppose 
that $(x^{n})_{n\in\N}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\H$, where $x^{n} = 
(x^n_i)_{i\in I}$ for each $n$. Then given any positive $\epsilon$, there exists 
a positive integer $N$ such that
\begin{align*}
	\left\|x^m-x^n\right\| < \epsilon \mbox{ for all } m,n\geq N,
\end{align*}
that is,
\begin{align}\label{eqn:sum1}
	\sum_{i\in I}{\left\|x^m_i-x^n_i\right\|^2} < \epsilon^2 \mbox{ for all } m,n\geq N.
\end{align}

Hence for each $i\in I$,
\begin{align*}
	\left\|x^m_i-x^n_i\right\| < \epsilon \mbox{ for all } m,n\geq N
\end{align*}
so that $(x^n_i)_{n\in\N}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\H_i$, having a limit $x_i\in\H_i$.
For any finite subset $J\subset I$, it follows from equation \eqref{eqn:sum1} that 
\begin{align*}
	\sum_{j\in J}{\left\|x^m_j-x^n_j\right\|^2} < \epsilon^2  \mbox{ for all } m,n\geq N,
\end{align*}
and letting $m$ tend to infinity,
\begin{align}\label{eqn:sum2}
	\sum_{j\in J}{\left\|x_j-x^n_j\right\|^2} < \epsilon^2  \mbox{ for all } n\geq N.
\end{align}
This holds for any finite subset $J$, so
\begin{align*}
	\sum_{i\in I}{\left\|x_i-x^n_i\right\|^2} < \epsilon^2  \mbox{ for all } n\geq N,
\end{align*}
and so $(x_i-x^n_i)$ and $x^n_i$ are in $\H$ for $n\geq N$. Then $(x_i)$ is in 
$\H$ and by equation \eqref{eqn:sum2}, $x^n$ converges to $(x_i)$ as $n$ tends to 
infinity. We conclude that $\H$ is complete and therefore a Hilbert space. Just 
like in the finite case, we call $\H$ the \emph{direct sum} of the collection 
$\left\{\H_i \mid i\in I\right\}$ of Hilbert spaces, denoted $\oplus\H_i$.


Suppose now we have a (finite or infinite) collection of bounded operators 
$\left\{T_i\in \B{(\H_i)} \mid i\in I\right\}$ such that
\begin{align*}
	\sup_{i\in I} {\left\|T_i\right\|} < \infty
\end{align*} 
(by convention this is true when $I$ is a finite set).
For $x=(x_i)$ in $\oplus\H_i$, define an element $Tx$ in $\oplus\H_i$ by 
$Tx=(T_ix_i)$. Then $T:\H\to\H:x\mapsto Tx$ is a bounded linear operator, called 
the \emph{direct sum} of the collection $\left\{T_i\in\B{(\H_i)} \mid i \in 
I\right\}$, denoted $\oplus T_i$. For $S_i,T_i$ in $\B(\H_i)$, $\alpha,\beta$ in 
$\C$, we have 
\begin{align*}
		\left(\oplus T_i\right)^\ast &= \oplus T_i^\ast,										\\
		\oplus (\alpha S_i+\beta T_i) &= 
					\alpha \oplus S_i + \beta \oplus T_i, 										\\
		\oplus (S_i T_i) &= \oplus S_i \oplus T_i,												\\
		\left\|\oplus T_i\right\| &= \sup_{i\in I} {\left\|T_i\right\|}.						\\
\end{align*}

\section{Topological Spaces}
By a \emph{topological space} we mean a set $X$ endowed with a collection $\T$ 
(a \emph{topology}) of subsets of $X$ such that $\T$ is closed under finite 
intersections and arbitrary unions, and contains both $X$ and the empty set. 
Elements of $\T$ are referred to as \emph{open sets}.
A \emph{neighbourhood} of a point $x$ is a subset of $X$ which contains an open 
set which itself contains $x$. An \emph{open cover} of $X$ is a collection 
$\cover$ of open sets whose union contains $X$, and a subset of $\cover$ which 
still covers $X$ is called a \emph{subcover}. 

A topological space $X$ is said to be:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{Hausdorff} if, for every distinct pair of points $x,y$ of $X$, 
	there is a neighbourhood of $x$ which is disjoint from some neighbourhood of $y$;
	\item \emph{compact} if every open cover of $X$ has a finite subcover;
	\item \emph{locally compact} if every point of $x$ has a compact neighbourhood.
\end{itemize}
Most of the topology we use will be compact and Hausdorff, and locally compact 
and Hausdorff at the least.

A subset $Y$ of $X$ is said to be \emph{dense} in $X$ every non-empty open set 
in $X$ contains an element of $A$ -- equivalently, if $X$ is the largest closed 
set containing $Y$.The topology \emph{generated by a collection $\B$} is the 
collection $\T$ containing $\B$ and all finite intersections and arbitrary 
unions over $\B$. It is the weakest topology on $X$ containing $\B$, in the 
sense that any topology containing $\B$ contains all of $\T$.

A \emph{topological vector space} is a vector space $V$ over $\R$ or $\C$, 
together with a topology on $V$ such that the vector space operations $V\times 
V\to V:(x,y)\mapsto x+y$ and $\mathbb{K}\times V\to V:(\lambda,x)\mapsto \lambda 
x$ are continuous (with respect to $\left|\cdot\right|$). Recall that an 
\emph{extreme point} of a convex subset $X_0$ of a topological vector space is a 
point $x$ for which an expression
\begin{align*}
	x = \alpha x_1 +(1-\alpha)x_2,
\end{align*}
for $0\leq\alpha\leq1$ and $x_1,x_2\in X_0$, implies that $x_1=x=x_2$. 
The convex set $X_0$ is then equal to the set of all linear combinations
\begin{align*}
	\alpha_1 x_1+\dots +\alpha_n x_n
\end{align*}
of its extreme points, where $\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n$ are positive scalars 
summing to 1. For example, for a polygon embedded in $\R^2$, the vertices of a 
polygon are its extreme points, and every point within the polygon can be 
written as a linear combination of the vertices.


\begin{lemma}[{\cite[1.4.4]{kadison83}}]\label{lemma:144}
If $X$ is a non-empty, compact, convex subset of a locally convex space $V$, and 
$\rho$ is a continuous linear functional on $V$, then there is an extreme point 
$x_0$ of $X$ such that, for every $x$ in $X$,
	\begin{align*}
		\Real\rho(x) \leq \Real\rho(x_0).
	\end{align*}
\end{lemma}

\begin{defn*}[{\cite[3.14]{rudin91}}]
	Let $X$ be a topological vector space (over a field $\mathbb K$), with dual 
	space $X^\ast$. Every $x$ in $X$ induces a linear functional $f_x$ on $X^\ast$ 
	defined by $f_x(\rho)=\rho(x)$. The \emph{weak$^\ast$ topology} on $X^\ast$ is 
	the topology generated by the sets 
	\begin{align*}
		\left\{f^{-1}_x(V) \mid x \in X, V\subseteq \mathbb K \mbox{ open}\right\}.
	\end{align*}
	This is the weakest topology on $X$ such that each functional $f_x$ is 
	continuous, and the collection $\left\{f_x \mid x\in X\right\}$ separate the 
	points of $X^\ast$, so the weak$^\ast$ topology is Hausdorff.
\end{defn*}

\begin{thm*}[{The Banach-Alaoglu theorem \cite{rudin91}}]
	If $V$ is a neighbourhood of $0$ in a topological vector space $X$, and
	\begin{align*}
		K=\left\{\rho\in X^\ast \mid |\rho(x)|\leq 1 \mbox{ for all } x \in V \right\},
	\end{align*}
	then $K$ is compact in the weak$^\ast$ topology.
\end{thm*}

\chapter{$C^\ast$-Algebras}
We begin this chapter with some definitions and an important example, then give 
some results we will need later and finish with another fundamental example.

\section{Definition}
\begin{defn}
	A \emph{Banach algebra} is a complex Banach space $A$, with norm 
	$\left\|\cdot\right\|$, which forms an algebra, such that 
	\begin{align*}
		\left\|ab\right\| \leq 
				\left\|a\right\| \left\|b\right\| \mbox{ for all } a,b \in A.
	\end{align*}
	
	A \emph{$\ast$-algebra} is an algebra $A$ with an \emph{involution} map 
	$a \mapsto a^\ast$ on $A$ such that, for all $a,b \in A$ and for $\alpha \in \C$,
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $a^{\ast\ast} = (a^\ast)^\ast = a$;
		\item $(\alpha a+b)^\ast = \overline{\alpha} a^\ast + b^\ast$;
		\item $(ab)^\ast = b^\ast a^\ast$.
	\end{enumerate}
	The element $a^\ast$ is referred to as the \emph{adjoint} of $a$. 
	
	A \emph{$C^\ast$-algebra} is a Banach algebra $A$ with involution $a \mapsto 
	a^\ast$ making it a $\ast$-algebra, with the condition that

	\begin{align*}
		\left\|a ^\ast a\right\| = \left\|a\right\|^2 \mbox{ for all } a \in A.
	\end{align*}
	This condition is known as the \emph{$C^\ast$ axiom}.
	
	A subalgebra $B$ of a $C^\ast$-algebra $A$ is a \emph{$C^\ast$-subalgebra} if it 
	is closed under the adjoint and complete with respect to the norm; equivalently, 
	if $B$ is itself a $C^\ast$-algebra.

	
	An element $a\in A$ of a $C^\ast$-algebra is called
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	\emph{normal} if $a^\ast a=aa^\ast$;
		\item 	\emph{self-adjoint} if $a^\ast=a$;
		\item 	\emph{unitary} if $a^\ast a = aa^\ast =\1$. 
	\end{itemize}
\end{defn}
The set of self-adjoint elements $A_{sa}$ forms a vector space over $\R$.
Note that an element being self-adjoint, or unitary, implies that it is normal.

As a simple example, we can consider $\C$ as a $C^\ast$-algebra: We know from 
complex analysis that Cauchy sequences converge in $\C$ and that complex 
conjugation is an involutive operation. In this way we can interpret 
self-adjoint elements of a $C^\ast$-algebra $A$ as `reals' -- in fact, for $a$ 
in $A$, let $h=\tfrac{1}{2}(a+a^\ast)$ and $k=\tfrac{i}{2}(a-a^\ast)$. Then $h$ 
and $k$ are self-adjoint and we can write $a=h+ik$ -- call $h$ and $k$ the 
\emph{real} and \emph{imaginary} part of $a$, respectively. 

\section{Unitization}
If a $C^\ast$-algebra $A$ contains a multiplicative identity element $\1$, such 
that $a \1 = a = \1  a$ for all $a \in A$, call $\1$ the \emph{unit} in $A$, and 
$A$ is then a \emph{unital} $C^\ast$-algebra.

\begin{prop*}[{\cite[I.1.3]{davidson96}}]
	Any non-unital $C^\ast$-algebra $A$ can be isometrically embedded in a unital 
	$C^\ast$-algebra $\tilde{A}$.

\end{prop*}
\begin{proof}
	Let $\tilde{A} = A \oplus \C$ with pointwise addition, and define
	\begin{align*}
		(a,\lambda) (b,\mu) &= (ab+\lambda b + \mu a, \lambda \mu),								\\
		(a,\lambda)^\ast &= (a^\ast,\overline{\lambda}).
	\end{align*}
	Then $\tilde{A}$ is a $\ast$-algebra. 
	Consider $(a,\lambda)$ as an operator acting on $A$ via $b\mapsto ab+\lambda b$ 
	for $b$ in $A$. It is easy to see that this operator is linear, and 
	\begin{align*}
				\sup_{\left\|b\right\|=1}\left\|ab+\lambda b\right\| 
		&\leq 	\sup_{\left\|b\right\|=1} (\left\|ab\right\|+ \lambda\left\|b\right\|)			\\
		&=		\sup_{\left\|b\right\|=1} \left\|ab\right\|+ \lambda < \infty
	\end{align*}
	so that the operator $(a,\lambda)$ is bounded. It follows that
	\begin{align*}
		\left\|(a,\lambda)\right\| = \sup_{\left\|b\right\|=1}\left\|ab+\lambda b\right\|
	\end{align*}
	is a norm on $\tilde{A}$, and so $\tilde{A}$ is a Banach $\ast$-algebra, with unit $(0,1)$.
	The embedding $a\mapsto(a,\lambda)$ is isometric because 
	\begin{align*}
		\left\|a\right\| = \left\|a\cdot\frac{a}{\left\|a\right\|}\right\| 
						 \leq \left\|(a,0)\right\| 
						 \leq \sup_{\left\|b\right\|=1}{\left\|ab\right\|} 
						 \leq \left\|a\right\|.
	\end{align*}
	
	It remains to verify the $C^\ast$-axiom:
	\begin{align*}
				\left\|(a,\lambda)\right\|^2 
		&=		\sup_{\left\|b\right\|=1}{\left\| ab+\lambda b\right \|^2}						\\
		&=		\sup_{\left\|b\right\|=1}{\left\| b^\ast a^\ast ab 
								+\lambda b^\ast a^\ast b
								+\overline{\lambda}b^\ast a b 
								+|\lambda|^2 b^\ast b \right\|}									\\
		&\leq	\sup_{\left\|b\right\|=1}{\left\| a^\ast ab 
								+\lambda a^\ast b
								+\overline{\lambda}a b
								+\left|\lambda\right|^2 b\right\|}								\\
		&=		\left\|(a^\ast a + \lambda a^\ast +\overline{\lambda}a,|\lambda|^2)\right\|		\\
		&= 		\left\|(a,\lambda)^\ast(a,\lambda)\right\|										\\
		&\leq	\left\|(a,\lambda)^\ast\right\| \left\|(a,\lambda)\right\|.
	\end{align*}
	By symmetry of $\ast$, $\left\|(a,\lambda)^\ast\right\| = \left\|(a,\lambda)\right\|$. 
	Hence, the above inequality becomes equality and we have that
	\begin{align*}
		\left\|(a,\lambda)^\ast(a,\lambda)\right\| = \left\|(a,\lambda)\right\|^2,
	\end{align*}
	and $\tilde A$ is a $C^\ast$-algebra.
\end{proof}

In light of this result, we take all $C^\ast$-algebras from here to be unital 
unless specified otherwise. For the results we will consider, we can simply take 
the unital case. However, there are circumstances in advanced theory in which 
one needs to relax the unital condition, where properties do not pass from a 
$C^\ast$-algebra to its maximal ideals, so it is by no means a universal 
assumption that a $C^\ast$-algebra has a unit element.


\section{Continuous Functions on a Compact Hausdorff Space} \label{section:CX}
Given a compact Hausdorff space $X$, let $\CX$ be the algebra of continuous 
functions $f:X\to\C$, with addition and multiplication defined pointwise. 
Define $\|\cdot\|$ on $\CX$ by
\begin{align*}
	\left\|f\right\|= \sup_{x\in X}{\left|f(x)\right|},
\end{align*}
and let $\overline f$ be the function $\overline f(x) = \overline{f(x)}$ for 
$x$ in $X$. We will demonstrate that $\CX$ is an Abelian $C^\ast$-algebra and 
preview some of the theory we will build up in later sections. Later, in 
Section \ref{section:abelian}, we will show that $\CX$ is essentially \emph{the} 
Abelian $C^\ast$-algebra.

\begin{claim}
	The set $\CX$, of continuous complex valued functions on a compact Hausdorff 
	space $X$, is an Abelian $C^\ast$-algebra.
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
	We take $\CX$ as an algebra with operations defined pointwise and norm defined 
	as above. Multiplication in $\CX$ is pointwise, so analogous to multiplication 
	in $\C$, hence commutative. Showing that $\CX$ is a Banach space with this norm 
	is a simple exercise. We will demonstrate that $\CX$ is a Banach algebra, that 
	$f\mapsto\overline{f}$ is an involution, and that the norm satisfies the 
	$C^\ast$ axiom.
	
	Given $f$ and $g$ in $\CX$, we have $\left\|f(x)g(x)\right\| = 
	\left\|f(x)\right\|\left\|g(x)\right\|$ for all $x$ in $X$, and so 
	\begin{align*}
				\left\|fg\right\| 
		&= 		\sup_{x\in X}|(fg)(x)|														\\
		&= 		\sup_{x\in X}|f(x)g(x)|														\\
		&=		\sup_{x\in X}|f(x)||g(x)|													\\
		&\leq	\left\|f\right\|\left\|g\right\|.
	\end{align*}
	
	Since $f\mapsto\overline{f}$ is simply pointwise complex conjugation, and the 
	algebraic operations are defined pointwise, it is clear that it is an 
	involution. For the $C^\ast$ axiom: given $f$ in $\CX$,
	\begin{align*}
				\left\|\bar f f\right\| 
		&= 		\sup_{x\in X}|(\bar f f)(x)|												\\
		&= 		\sup_{x\in X}|\bar{f(x)} f(x)|												\\
		&=		\sup_{x\in X}|f(x)|^2														\\
		&=		\left\|f\right\|^2.
	\end{align*}
	The constant function $\1:X\to\C:x\mapsto 1$ is the unit in $\CX$, 
	with $\left\|\1\right\| = 1$.
\end{proof}

Suppose that $f$ is a self-adjoint element of $\CX$ -- that is to say, $\bar f = 
f$. Then~$\bar{f(x)} = f(x)$ for all $x$ in $X$, so $f$ is real-valued on $X$. 
The set of all self-adjoints in $\CX$ is the algebra $C(X,\R)$ of all real 
valued functions on $X$. Call $f$ \emph{positive} if $f(x)$ is positive for all 
$x$ in $X$. 
A linear functional $\rho$ on $\CX$ is \emph{positive} if $\rho(f)\geq 0$ for 
all positive elements $f$, and a \emph{state} on $\CX$ if $\rho$ is positive and 
$\rho(\1)=1$. The \emph{state space} $\S$, the set of all states on $\CX$, is a 
convex set, and extreme points of $\S$ are called \emph{pure states} on $\CX$.


Given $x$ in $X$, define $\rho_x$ by $\rho_x:\CX\to\C:f\mapsto f(x)$. If $f$ is 
positive, then $\rho_x(f) \geq 0$, and $\rho_x(\1) = \1(x)=1$, so $\rho_x$ is a 
state for all $x$. We can also see that these functionals are multiplicative, 
and it can be shown (see \cite[Corollary 3.4.2]{kadison83}) that every non-zero 
multiplicative functional on $\CX$ arises in this way, as `evaluation' at some 
point of $X$, and the general fact that the non-zero multiplicative linear 
functionals are exactly the pure states on a $C^\ast$-algebra (which we will 
show in Proposition \ref{prop:puremult}) shows that these are in fact all of the 
pure states on $\CX$.


The following is a result which is crucial in the proof of the commutative 
Gelfand-Naimark theorem. We state it without proof here as the proof is long and 
involved, and doesn't contribute to understanding. The proof, along with a 
discussion of other consequences of the theorem, can be found in Section 3.4 of 
\cite{kadison83}.


\begin{thm*}[Stone-Weierstrass theorem {\cite[3.4.15]{kadison83}}]
	Let $A$ be a norm-closed subalgebra of $\CX$, containing the constant function 
	$\1$ and the conjugate function $\bar f$ for each $f$ in $A$. If for each pair 
	of distinct points $p\not=p'$ in $X$, there is an $f$ in $A$ such that 
	$f(p)\not=f(p')$, then $A=\CX$.

\end{thm*}

The term `norm-closed' means that the set is closed in the norm topology, 
meaning it contains all its limit points. If the condition in the statement of 
the theorem holds, say that \emph{$A$ separates the points of $X$}.


We finish this section by remarking that if we take $X$ to be a non-compact, 
\emph{locally} compact Hausdorff space, then we are required to take $\CX$ to be 
the set of continuous complex valued functions which \emph{vanish at infinity} 
in some sense\footnote{We say $f:X\to\C$ \emph{vanishes at infinity} if for all 
positive $\epsilon$ there exists a compact subset $K$ of $X$ such that 
$\left|f(x)\right|<\epsilon$ for all $x$ outside of $K$.}. This restriction 
ensures that the supremum used to define the norm on $\CX$ exists -- however, we 
lose the constant function $\1$, so $\CX$ is no longer unital. 
It turns out that the unitization of $\CX$ corresponds to the continuous 
functions on the one-point compactification of $X$ -- see 
\cite[II.1.2.2]{blackadar06}.



\section{The Spectrum}
We will just state the necessary definitions and results here, proofs can be 
found in the relevant sources.

\begin{defn}
	Given an element $a$ of a Banach algebra $A$, define its spectrum $\sigma_A(a)$:
	\begin{align*}
		\sigma_A(a)=\left\{\lambda\in \C \mid a-\lambda\1 
								\mbox{ is not invertible in }A\right\},
	\end{align*}
	where $a$ is \emph{invertible in $A$} if there exists an element $b\in A$ such 
	that $ab=\1=ba$. Say that $\lambda\in\spec a$ is a \emph{spectral value} of $a$ 
	in $A$. If it is clear from context where we are taking the spectrum, then we 
	write $\spec{a}$ for $\sigma_A(a)$. 
\end{defn}

\begin{thm*}[{\cite[3.2.3]{kadison83}}]
	If $a$ is an element of a Banach algebra $A$ then $\spec a$ is a non-empty 
	closed subset of the closed disk in $\C$ with center $0$ and radius 
	$\left\|a\right\|$.
\end{thm*}

The \emph{spectral radius}, $r(a)$, of $a$ is the radius of the smallest disk in 
$\C$ containing $\spec a$; that is, 
\begin{align*}
	r(a)=\sup_{\lambda\in\spec a}{|\lambda|}.
\end{align*}
By the above theorem, $r(a)\leq\left\|a\right\|$. 

\begin{thm*}[Spectral radius formula {\cite[3.3.3]{kadison83}}]
	The spectral radius of an element $a$ of a Banach algebra is given by the formula
	\begin{align*}
		r(a)= \lim_{n\to\infty} \left\|a^n\right\|^{1/n}.
	\end{align*}
\end{thm*}

\begin{lemma}[{\cite[4.1.1(i)]{kadison83}}]\label{lemma:411}
	If $a$ is a normal element of a $C^\ast$-algebra, then $r(a)=\left\|a\right\|$.
\end{lemma}

From this it can be shown that the norm on a $C^\ast$-algebra $A$ is unique, in 
the sense that only one norm on $A$ can satisfy the $C^\ast$-axiom. 
\cite[II.1.6.5]{blackadar06}




\begin{thm*}[Continuous functional calculus, {\cite[4.1.3]{kadison83}}]
	Given a self-adjoint element $a$, we denote by $C(\spec a)$ the $C^\ast$-algebra 
	of continuous, complex valued functions on the spectrum of $a$. There is a 
	unique continuous mapping $C(\spec a):f\mapsto f(a)$ such that:
	\emph{\begin{enumerate}
		\item	\emph{if $f$ is a polynomial, }$f(z)=\alpha_1+\alpha_2z+\dots+
			\alpha_mz^m$\emph{, then} 
				\begin{align*}
					f(a)=\alpha_1\1+\alpha_2a+\dots+\alpha_ma^m;
				\end{align*}
		\item	$\left\|f(a)\right\| = \left\|f\right\|$;
		\item	$(\alpha f+\beta g)(a) = \alpha f(a) + \beta g(a)$;
		\item	$fg(a)=f(a)g(a)$;
		\item	$\overline{f}(a) = (f(a))^\ast$;
		\item	$f(a)$ \emph{is normal};
		\item	$f(a)b=bf(a)$ \emph{for all $b$ in $A$ such that} $ab=ba$.
	\end{enumerate}}
	Moreover, each $f$ in $C(\spec a)$ is the limit of a sequence of polynomials 
	over $\C$.
\end{thm*}

\begin{thm*}[Spectral mapping theorem, {\cite[4.1.6]{kadison83}}]
	If $a$ is a self adjoint element of a $C^\ast$-algebra $A$, and 
	$f\in C(\spec a)$, then
	\begin{align*}
		\spec{f(a)} = \left\{f(t) \mid t \in \spec a\right\}.
	\end{align*}
\end{thm*}

\begin{prop}[{\cite[4.2.3(i)]{kadison83}}]\label{prop:423}
	Given $f$ in $C(\spec a)$, $f(t)\geq0$ for all $t$ in $\spec a$ if and only if 
	$f(a)$ is self-adjoint and $\spec{f(a)} \subseteq \R^+$.
\end{prop}

\begin{thm*}[{\cite[4.1.5]{kadison83}}]
	If $B$ is a $C^\ast$-subalgebra of a $C^\ast$-algebra $A$, and $b$ is an 
	element of $B$, then 
	\begin{align*}
		\sigma_B(b) =\sigma_A(b).
	\end{align*}
\end{thm*}


As an aside, this theorem allows us to make the convention that the spectrum of 
an element $a$ in a non-unital $C^\ast$-algebra $A$ is defined to be 
the~spectrum of $a$ in the unitization $\tilde A$ of $A$.





\section{Further Definitions and Results}
In this section we will set out some further definitions, some of which we have 
already seen in the context of $\CX$, and prove some cool results.


\begin{defn}
	An element $a$ of a $C^\ast$-algebra $A$ is \emph{positive} if it is 
	self-adjoint and $\spec a\subseteq \R^+$. Denote the set of positive elements 
	in $A$ by $A^+$. Then $A_{sa}$ is a partially ordered vector space with $\leq$ 
	given by
	\begin{align*}
		a\leq b ~~\iff~~ b-a \mbox{ is positive}
	\end{align*}
	for $a,b$ in $A_{sa}$.
	The set of positive elements form a positive cone in $A_{sa}$, which means that 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item 	$\alpha a+b\in A^+$ for all $a,b \in A^+$ and $\alpha\in \R^+$;
		\item	$a\in A^+$ and $-a\in A^+$ implies that $a=0$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{defn}

The unit $\1$ is positive (with $\spec \1 = \left\{1\right\}$). 

\begin{lemma}[{\cite[4.2.3(ii)]{kadison83}}]\label{lemma:423}
	For a self-adjoint element $a$ in a $C^\ast$-algebra $A$, 
	\begin{align*}
		-\left\|a\right\|\1 \leq a\leq\left\|a\right\|\1.
	\end{align*}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Let $f$ in $C(\spec a)$ defined by $f(t) = \left\|a\right\| \pm t$, $f$ takes 
	non-negative values on $\spec a$, so by Proposition \ref{prop:423}, $f(a)$ is 
	positive; that is, $\left\|a\right\|\1 \pm a$ is positive.

\end{proof}
	
\begin{defn}
	Given Banach $\ast$-algebras $A$ and $B$, a map $\phi:A\to B$ is a 
	\emph{$\ast$-homomorphism} if it is an algebra homomorphism for which 
	$\phi(a^\ast) = \phi(a)^\ast$ for all $a \in A$. If a $\ast$-homomorphism is 
	bijective, call it a \emph{$\ast$-isomorphism}.
\end{defn}
\begin{prop}[{\cite[4.1.8]{kadison83}}] \label{prop:homo}
	Suppose $A$ and $B$ are $C^\ast$-algebras and $\phi:A\to B$ is a 
	$\ast$-homomorphism. Then $\left\|\phi(a)\right\| \leq \left\|a\right\|$ for all 
	$a \in A$. If $\phi$ is a $\ast$-isomorphism, then $\left\|\phi(a)\right\| = 
	\left\|a\right\|$ for all $a \in A$.


\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
	With $a$ in $A$, if $\alpha$ is not a spectral value for $a$, $\alpha\1_A-a$ has 
	an inverse $s$ in $A$. Since $\phi(\1_A) =\1_b$, $\alpha \1_A-\phi(a)$ has 
	inverse $\phi(s)$ in $B$, so $\alpha$ is not a spectral value of $\phi(a)$; 
	hence $\spec {\phi(a)}\subseteq \spec a$, and in particular, $r(\phi(a))\leq 
	r(a)$. By Lemma \ref{lemma:411}, since $a^\ast a$ is normal, we have 
	\begin{align*}
		\left\|a\right\|^2			
					&=	\left\|a^\ast a\right\|   = 	r(a^\ast a);  \mbox{ and }			\\
		\left\|\phi(a)\right\|^2 &=\left\|\phi(a)^\ast\phi(a)\right\| = 
							 \left\|\phi(a^\ast a)\right\| = r(\phi(a^\ast a)).
	\end{align*}
	so $\left\|\phi(a)\right\|\leq \left\|a\right\|$.
	
	If $a$ is a self-adjoint element of $A$ and $f \in C(\spec a)$, then 
	$\phi(f(a))=f(\phi(a))$. This follows from the final assertion of the continuous 
	functional calculus.

	
	Now suppose $\phi$ is a $\ast$-isomorphism, and for a self-adjoint $a$ in $A$, 
	suppose $\spec{\phi(a)} \subsetneq \spec a$. Then there is a non-zero $f$ in 
	$C(\spec a)$ whose restriction to $\spec{\phi(a)}$ is 0. From the previous 
	paragraph, however, $\phi(f(a)) = f(\phi(a))=0$, so that $f(a)\not= 0$ is in the 
	kernel of $\phi$; thus contradicting the assumption that $\phi$ is one-to-one, 
	and we conclude that $\spec{\phi(a)} = \spec a$. A similar argument to the one 
	in the first half of this proof shows that $\left\|\phi(a)\right\| = 
	\left\|a\right\|$ and completes the proof.


\end{proof}
This result shows that $\ast$-homomorphisms between $C^\ast$-algebras are 
automatically bound-ed (and hence continuous), and $\ast$-isomorphisms are 
isometries, demonstrating how the algebraic and topological structure of these 
spaces is tied together by the $C^\ast$ axiom.


\begin{defn}
	A linear functional $\rho$ on a $C^\ast$-algebra $A$ is \emph{positive} if 
	$\rho(a)\geq 0$ for all $a\in A^+$. A \emph{state} on $A$ is a positive linear 
	functional $\rho$ such that $\rho(\1)=1$. Denote the set of all states on $A$ by 
	$\S(A)$. Given a linear functional $\rho$ on $A$, the equation $\rho^\ast(a) 
	=\bar{\rho(a^\ast)}$ defines a functional $\rho^\ast$, and call $\rho$ 
	\emph{Hermitian} if $\rho=\rho^\ast$.

\end{defn}
Hermitian functionals take real values on self-adjoint elements, and all 
positive linear functionals are Hermitian.We can extend the partial order 
notation to linear functionals. Given linear functionals $\rho,\tau$ on $A$, 
define $\leq$ by
\begin{align*}
	\rho \leq \tau ~~\iff~~ \tau - \rho \mbox{ is positive}.
\end{align*}

When we take $\C$ as a $C^\ast$-algebra, the positive elements are exactly the 
positive reals, and the linear functionals are given by multiplication by a 
complex number. Positive linear functionals correspond again to the positive 
reals, and the only state on $\C$ is `multiplication by $1$'.
Extending the analogy between $\C$ and a $C^\ast$-algebra $A$, we can even show 
that a positive element has a unique positive square root, and that $a^\ast a$ 
is positive for all $a$ in $A$. (See \cite[4.2.5 and 4.2.6]{kadison83}).



\begin{prop}[{\cite[4.3.2]{kadison83}}]\label{prop:432}
	A linear functional $\rho$ on a $C^\ast$-algebra $A$ is positive if and only if 
	$\rho$ is bounded and $\left\|\rho\right\| = \rho(\1)$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose that $\rho$ is positive. With $a$ in $A$, let $\alpha$ be a scalar of 
	modulus $1$ such that $\alpha\rho(a)\geq 0$, and let $h$ be the real part of 
	$a$.Since $h$ is self adjoint, (by 4.2.3(ii)) we have $h \leq \left\|h\right\|\1 
	\leq \left\|a\right\|\1$. Thus, $\left\|a\right\|\1-h$ is positive and 
	\begin{align*}
		\rho(\left\|a\right\|\1-h) = \left\|a\right\|\rho(\1)-\rho(h) \geq 0.
	\end{align*}
	Therefore,
	\begin{align*}
		|\rho(a)| 	= \rho(\alpha a) = \overline{\rho(\alpha a)} 
					= \rho(\overline{\alpha}a^\ast) 
					= \rho(\tfrac{1}{2}(\alpha a +\overline{\alpha}a^\ast))
					= \rho(h) \leq \rho(\1) \left\|a\right\|,
	\end{align*}
	so $\rho$ is bounded and $\left\|\rho\right\| \leq \rho(\1)$. We also have 
	$\left\|\rho\right\| = \sup\left\{\rho(a) \mid \left\|a\right| = 1\right\} \geq 
	\rho(\1)$, so $\left\|\rho\right\|=\rho(\1)$.

	
	Conversely, suppose $\rho$ is bounded and $\left\|\rho\right\| = \rho(\1)$ -- we 
	can assume without loss that $\rho(\1)=1$. With $a$ a positive element of $A$, 
	let $\rho(a)=\alpha+i\beta$ for real $\alpha,\beta$. Then $\rho$ is positive if 
	and only if $\alpha \geq 0$ and $\beta = 0$.

	For small positive $s$, 
	\begin{align*}
		\spec{\1-sa} = \left\{1-st \mid t\in \spec{a} 
							\subseteq \R^+\right\} \subseteq [0,1],
	\end{align*}
	so $\left\|\1-sa\right\| = r(\1-sa) \leq 1$. Hence
	\begin{align*}
		1-s\alpha \leq |1-s(\alpha+i\beta)| = |\rho(\1 - sa)| \leq 1,
	\end{align*}
	so $\alpha\geq0$. With $b_n$ in $A$ defined by $b_n= a+(in\beta-\alpha)\1$ for 
	each positive integer $n$,

	\begin{align*}
				\left\|b_n\right\|^2 = \left\|b_n^\ast b_n\right\| 
		&= 		\left\|(a-\alpha\1)^2 + n^2\beta^2\1\right\| 								\\
		&\leq 	\left\|a-\alpha\1\right\|^2 +n^2\beta^2.
	\end{align*}
	Hence for all positive integers $n$, we have
	\begin{align*}
				(n^2+2n+1)\beta 
		&=	 	|\rho(b_n)|^2  																\\
		&\leq 	\left\|a-\beta\1\right\|^2 +n^2\beta^2,
	\end{align*}
	so that $\beta=0$. We conclude that $\rho$ is positive.
\end{proof}



The following result follows easily from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for inner 
products.
\begin{prop*}[Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, {\cite[4.3.1]{kadison83}}]
	If $\rho$ is a positive linear functional on $C^\ast$-algebra $A$, then for all 
	$a$ and $b$ in $A$,
	\begin{align*}
		|\rho(b^\ast a)|^2 \leq \rho(a^\ast a)\rho(b^\ast b).
	\end{align*}
\end{prop*}


\begin{lemma}[{\cite[4.3.3]{kadison83}}]\label{lemma:433}
	Let $A$ be a $C^\ast$-algebra. For any $a$ in $A$ and $\alpha\in\spec{a}$, there 
	exists a state $\rho$ on $A$ such that $\rho(a)=\alpha$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	For all complex numbers $\beta$ and $\gamma$, $\alpha\beta+\gamma$ is a spectral 
	value for the element $\beta a+\gamma\1$ of $A$, so 
	\begin{align*}
		|\alpha\beta+\gamma|\leq r(\beta a+\gamma\1)=\left\|\beta a+\gamma\1\right\|.
	\end{align*} 
	Hence the equation $\rho_0(s)=\alpha\beta+\gamma$ defines a bounded linear 
	functional$\rho_0$ on the linear subspace $B= \left\{\beta a+\gamma\1 \mid 
	\beta,\gamma\in\C\right\}$ of $A$, with $\rho_0(a) =\alpha$ and 
	$\rho_0(\1)=1=\left\|\rho_0\right\|$. By the Hahn-Banach theorem, $\rho_0$ 
	extends to a bounded linear functional $\rho$ on $A$, with 
	$\left\|\rho\right\|=1$, such that $\rho=\rho_0$ on the subspace $B$. In 
	particular, $\rho(\1)=1=\left\|\rho\right\|$ so $\rho$ is positive by the 
	previous result, and $\rho(a)=\alpha$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[{\cite[4.3.4,(i)]{kadison83}}]\label{lemma:state1}
	Let $A$ be a $C^\ast$-algebra. If $\rho(a)=0$ for all states $\rho$ on $A$, 
	then $a=0$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose first that $a$ is self-adjoint, and $\rho(a)=0$ for all states $\rho$. 
	By the previous result, $\spec{a}=\left\{0\right\}$, so 
	$\left\|a\right\|=r(a)=0$ (using Lemma \ref{lemma:411}). Hence $a=0$.

	Now write $a=h+ik$, for $h$ and $k$ the real and imaginary part of $a$ 
	respectively. Then
	\begin{align*}
		0=\rho(a)=\rho(h)+i\rho(k),
	\end{align*}
	and as $h,k$ are self-adjoint, $\rho(h)$ and $\rho(k)$ are real and we must have 
	$\rho(h)=0=\rho(k)$. By previous statement, $h=0=k$, and we conclude that $a=0$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[{\cite[4.3.4,(iv)]{kadison83}}]\label{lemma:state2}
	If $a$ is a normal element of a $C^\ast$-algebra $A$, there is a state $\rho$ 
	on $A$ such that $|\rho(a)|=\left\|a\right\|$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	By Lemma \ref{lemma:411}, $r(a)=\left\|a\right\|$, so $\spec a$ contains a 
	complex number $\alpha$ such that $|\alpha|=\left\|a\right\|$. By Lemma 
	\ref{lemma:433}, $\alpha=\rho(a)$ for some state $\rho$, so 
	\begin{align*}
		|\rho(a)|=|\alpha|=\left\|a\right\|.
	\end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{defn}
	An extreme point of $\S(A)$ is called a \emph{pure} state on $A$, and the set 
	of pure states on $A$ is denoted by $\P{A}$.
\end{defn}
The state space $\S(A)$ is then the closure, relative to the weak$^\ast$ 
topology, of the set of convex linear combinations of pure states. 
It is a simple exercise, using the fact that $A^+\subseteq A_{sa}$, to verify 
that a linear functional $\rho$ is a pure state on $A$ if and only if the 
restriction $\rho|_{A_{sa}}$ is a pure state on $A_{sa}$.
Conversely, every pure state on $A_{sa}$ extends to a pure state on $A$ with the 
same norm, by the Hahn-Banach theorem.
 

\begin{lemma}[{\cite[4.3.8,(i)]{kadison83}}]\label{lemma:pure1}
	Let $a$ be an element of a $C^\ast$-algebra $A$. If $\rho(a)=0$ for all 
	\emph{pure} states $\rho$ on $A$, then $a=0$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Since every state is the limit of a sequence of linear combinations of pure 
	states, if $\rho(a)=0$ for all pure states $\rho$ on $A$, then $\rho(a)=0$ for 
	\emph{all} states $\rho$ on $A$. The result follows immediately from Lemma 
	\ref{lemma:state1}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[{\cite[4.3.8,(iv)]{kadison83}}]\label{lemma:pure2}
	If $a$ is a normal element of a $C^\ast$-algebra $A$, there is a pure state 
	$\rho_0$ on $A$ such that $|\rho_0(a)|=\left\|a\right\|$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	By Lemma \ref{lemma:state2}, there is a scalar $\gamma$ and a state $\tau$ on 
	$A$ such that $\tau(a)=\gamma$ and $|\gamma|=\left\|a\right\|$. Define $\hat t 
	:A^\ast\to\C:\rho \mapsto\rho(t)$, and let $\alpha$ be a complex number such 
	that $|\alpha|=1$ and $\tau(\alpha a) = |c| = \left\|a\right\|$. From Lemma 
	\ref{lemma:144}, there is a $\rho_0$ in $\P A$ such that 
	\begin{align*}
				\left\|a\right\|
		&\geq 	|\rho_0(a)| \geq \Real \widehat {\alpha a}(\rho_0)							\\
		&\geq 	\sup_{\rho\in \S(A)} \Real\widehat {\alpha a}(\rho) 						\\
		&\geq	\Real\widehat {\alpha a}(\tau) 
				= \Real\tau(\alpha a) = \left\|a\right\|,
	\end{align*}
	so that $|\rho_0(a)|=\left\|a\right\|$.
\end{proof}

The following result gives a useful characterisation of pure states:
\begin{prop}[{\cite[3.4.6]{kadison83}}]\label{prop:pure2}
	A state $\rho$ on $A_{sa}$ is pure if and only if, for all positive linear 
	functionals $\tau$ on$A_{sa}$ such that $0\leq\tau\leq\rho$, we have $\tau 
	=\lambda\rho$ for some $\lambda\in\R$. 

\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose that $\tau =\lambda\rho$ for all $0\leq\tau\leq\rho$, and suppose we can 
	write $\rho=\alpha\rho_1+(1-\alpha)\rho_2$ for some $0\leq\alpha\leq1$ and some 
	$\rho_1,\rho_2 \in\S(A_{sa})$. Then $0\leq\alpha\rho_1\leq\rho$, so 
	$\alpha\rho_0 = \lambda\rho$. Then $\rho_1(\1)=1=\rho(\1)$, so $\alpha = 
	\lambda$ and $\rho_0 =\rho$. Similarly, we can show that $\rho_2=\rho$, and so 
	we conclude that $\rho$ is a pure state.

	
	Conversely, suppose that $\rho$ is a pure state and $0\leq\tau\leq\rho$. 
	Applying this to $\1$,we get $0\leq\tau(\1)\leq\rho(\1) = 1$. Let $\lambda = 
	\tau(\1)$. We work case-by-case: If $\lambda=0$, then for any $a\in A_{sa}$, 
	applying $\tau$ to $-\left\|a\right\|\1 \leq a \leq\left\|a\right\|\1$ (from 
	Lemma \ref{lemma:423}) gives
	\begin{align*}
		0&=		-\left\|a\right\|\lambda 													\\
		&= 		\tau(-\left\|a\right\|\1) 													\\
		&\leq 	\tau(a) 																	\\
		&\leq 	\tau(\left\|a\right\|\1) 													\\
		&= 		\left\|a\right\| \lambda = 0,
	\end{align*}
	so $\tau=0=\lambda\rho$.
	
	A similar argument shows that $\lambda=1$ implies $\tau-\rho=0$, so that 
	$\tau=\rho=\lambda\rho$. If $0\leq\lambda\leq 1$, we can write 
	$\rho=\lambda\rho_1+(1-\lambda)\rho_2$ for $\rho_1=\lambda^{-1}\tau$ and 
	$\rho_2=(1-\lambda)^{-1}(\rho-\tau)$. $\rho$ is pure so 
	$\tau=\lambda\rho_1=\lambda\rho$.

	
\end{proof}
Recall that a linear functional $\rho$ on a $C^\ast$-algebra $A$ is 
\emph{multiplicative} if $\rho(ab)=\rho(a)\rho(b)$ for all $a,b$ in $A$. The set 
of all non-zero multiplicative linear functionals on $A$ is known as the 
\emph{maximal ideal space} of $A$, denoted $\M_A$. This name hints at the fact 
that the kernel of each of these functionals is a maximal ideal of $A$, and all 
maximal ideals of $A$ arise in this way. \cite[Theorem I.2.5]{davidson96}


\begin{prop}[{\cite[4.4.1]{kadison83}}]\label{prop:puremult}
	The set of pure states on an Abelian $C^\ast$-algebra $A$ is precisely the 
	maximal ideal space of $A$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose $\rho$ is a pure state on $A$. To show that $\rho(ab)=\rho(a)\rho(b)$ 
	for $a,b,\in A$,we restrict attention to the case where $0\leq b\leq\1$. 
	Linearity gives us the general case.In this case, for $h\in A^+$ we have that 
	$0\leq hb\leq h$, so $0\leq\rho(hb)\leq\rho(h)$.Hence $\rho_b(a)=\rho(ab)$ for 
	$a\in A$ defines a positive linear functional on $A$ with $\rho_b\leq\rho$. The 
	restriction $\rho|_{A_{sa}}$ is a pure state on $A_{sa}$ and $\rho_b|_{A_{sa}} 
	\leq \rho|_{A_{sa}}$, and it follows from Proposition \ref{prop:pure2} that 
	$\rho_b|_{A_{sa}} = \alpha \rho|_{A_{sa}}$ for some $\alpha \in \R^+$.
	Hence $\rho_b = \alpha\rho$  and so for $a\in A$:
	\begin{align*}
		\rho(ab) = \rho_b(a) = \alpha\rho(a) = 
							\alpha\rho(\1)\rho(a) = \rho_b(\1)\rho(a) = \rho(b)\rho(a)
	\end{align*}
	
	Conversely, suppose $\rho$ is a multiplicative linear functional. By Lemma 
	\ref{lemma:3220}, $\rho$ is bounded and $\left\|\rho\right\|=\rho(\1)=1$, so by 
	Proposition \ref{prop:432}, $\rho$ is a state.Suppose we can write 
	$\rho=\alpha\rho_1+\beta\rho_2$ for states $\rho_1,\rho_2$ on $A$ and 
	$\alpha,\beta >0$ such that $\alpha+\beta=1$. For $c\in A_{sa}$, by the 
	Cauchy-Schwarz inequality we have for $j=1,2$:
	\begin{align*}
		\big(\rho_j(c)\big)^2 = \big(\rho_j(\1 c)\big)^2 
					\leq \rho_j(\1)\rho(c^2)=\rho(c^2).
	\end{align*}
	Then:
	\begin{align*}
				0
		&=		\rho(c^2)-\rho(c)^2 														\\
		&=		\alpha\rho_1(c^2)+\beta\rho_2(c^2) 
						- \big(\alpha\rho_1(c)+\beta\rho_2(c)\big)^2						\\
		&\geq	\alpha(\alpha+\beta)\rho_1(c)^2 
						+ \beta(\alpha+\beta)\rho_2(c)^2
						- \big(\alpha\rho_1(c)+\beta\rho_2(c)\big)^2						\\
		&=		\alpha\beta\big(\rho_1(c) - \rho_2(c)\big)^2.
	\end{align*}
	Hence $\rho_1(c)=\rho_2(c)$, for all $c\in A_{sa}$, so $\rho_1=\rho_2 =\rho$ and 
	we conclude that $\rho$ is a pure state.
\end{proof}


The set $\P A$ of pure states on $A$ is a subset of the dual space $A^\ast$, and 
when we take $A^\ast$ with the weak$^\ast$ topology, we get a compact Hausdorff 
space, which is the object of study in the Gelfand-Naimark theorem for 
commutative algebras.


\begin{lemma}[{\cite[3.2.20]{kadison83}}]\label{lemma:3220}
	The maximal ideal space of an Abelian Banach algebra $A$ form a compact subset of 
	the unit ball of the dual space $A^\ast$, relative to the weak$^\ast$ topology.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Follows from the Banach-Alaoglu theorem.
\end{proof}




\section{Bounded Operators on a Hilbert Space}\label{section:bh}
This section concerns the fundamental example of a $C^\ast$-algebra: the set 
$\B(\H)$ of bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space $\H$, otherwise known as 
\emph{operator algebras}. Here we will demonstrate that $\B(\H)$ is a 
$C^\ast$-algebra and discuss how the theory of $C^\ast$-algebras relates to 
quantum mechanics, the very subject which started the study of these objects, 
explaining a good deal of the terminology used here. 

\todo[inline]{potentially give a specific example of $\H=\C^n$}

\begin{claim} 
	$\B(\H)$ is a $C^\ast$-algebra with the operator norm 
	\begin{align*}
		\left\|T\right\|= \sup_{\left\|x\right\|=1}{\left\|Tx\right\|}
	\end{align*}
	and involution taking $T$ to its adjoint map $T^\ast$. 
	The identity map $I:x\mapsto x$ is a unit for $\BH$
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
	It is an easy exercise to show that $\left\|\cdot\right\|$ is a norm on $\BH$. 
	Let $\left\{T_n\right\}_{n\in\N}$ be a Cauchy sequence in $\BH$. Then for any 
	positive $\epsilon$, there is a positive integer $N$ such that 
	\begin{align*}
		\left\|T_m-T_n\right\| < \epsilon \mbox{ for all } m,n \geq N.
	\end{align*}
	Applying $T_m-T_n$ to $x \in \H$, we have 
	\begin{align}\label{eqn:cauchyTn}
		\left\|T_mx-T_nx\right\| 	\leq \left\|T_m-T_n\right\| \left\|x\right\| 
									< \epsilon \left\|x\right\|,
	\end{align}
	so $\left\{T_n x\right\}_{n\in\N}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\H$, converging to 
	an element in $\H$. Define a linear operator $T:\H \to \H$ by 
	\begin{align*}
		Tx= \lim_{n\to\infty}{T_nx} \mbox{ for } x \in \H.
	\end{align*}
	Taking limits as $m$ tends to infinity in equation \eqref{eqn:cauchyTn}, we obtain
	\begin{align*}
		\left\|Tx-T_nx\right\| < \epsilon \left\|x\right\| \mbox{ for all }n \geq N,
	\end{align*}
	and so we have that $T-T_n$ (and hence $T=(T-T_n)+T_n$) is a bounded operator and  
	\begin{align*}
		\left\|T-T_n\right\| <\epsilon \mbox{ for all }n \geq N.
	\end{align*}
	We conclude that $T_n \to T$, and so $\BH$ is complete.
	
	Since boundedness is equivalent to continuity on $\H$, given $S,T\in\BH$, the 
	operator $ST:\H \to \H: x \mapsto (S\circ T)(x)$ is bounded on $\H$. Given 
	$x\in\H$ and $\lambda\in\C$, 
	\begin{align*}
			((\lambda S)T)(x)
		&=	((\lambda S)\circ T)(x)															\\
		&=	\lambda S(Tx)																	\\
		&=	\lambda (S\circ T)(x)															\\
		&=	\lambda ST(x),		
	\end{align*} 
	so that $(\lambda S)T = \lambda ST$ in $\BH$. We have 
	\begin{align*}
				\left\|ST\right\|
		&=		\sup_{\left\|x\right\|=1}{\left\|STx\right\|} 								\\
		&=		\sup_{\left\|x\right\|=1}{\left\|S(Tx)\right\|} 							\\
		&\leq	\left\|S\right\| \sup_{\left\|x\right\|=1}{\left\|Tx\right\|} 				\\
		&=		\left\|S\right\| \left\|T\right\|.
	\end{align*}
	We conclude that $\BH$ is a Banach algebra.
	
	To see that $^\ast$ is an involution, use the fact that the adjoint 
	operator is unique for each operator and the following equalities.
	\begin{enumerate}
	\Item	\begin{align*}
				\langle (\alpha T+S)^\ast x,y\rangle 
			&=	\langle x, \alpha T+S y \rangle												\\
			&=	\overline{\alpha}\langle x,Ty\rangle + \langle x, Sy \rangle				\\
			&=	\overline{\alpha}\langle T^\ast x,y\rangle +
										 \langle S^\ast x, y \rangle						\\
			&=	\langle(\overline{\alpha} T^\ast + S^\ast) x, y \rangle.
			\end{align*}
	\Item 	\begin{align*}
				\langle (T^\ast)^\ast x,y\rangle 
			&=	\langle x, T^\ast y \rangle													\\
			&=	\overline{\langle T^\ast y,x \rangle}										\\
			&=	\overline{\langle y, Tx \rangle}											\\
			&=	\langle Tx,y\rangle.
			\end{align*}
	\Item	\begin{align*}
				\langle (ST)^\ast x,y \rangle
			&=	\langle x, STy \rangle														\\
			&=	\langle	S^\ast x,Ty \rangle													\\
			&=	\langle T^\ast S^\ast x,y \rangle.
		\end{align*}
	\end{enumerate}
	It remains to demonstrate the $C^\ast$-axiom on $\BH$. For all $x\in\H$, we have
	\begin{align*}
		\left\|Tx\right\|^2 = \langle Tx,Tx\rangle 
							=  \langle T^\ast Tx,x\rangle 
							\leq \left\|T^\ast T\right\| \left\|x\right\|^2,
	\end{align*}
	so that
	\begin{align*}
		\left\|T\right\|^2 	\leq \left\|T^\ast T\right\| 
							\leq \left\|T^\ast\right\| \left\|T\right\| 
							= \left\|T\right\|^2.
	\end{align*}
	It is clear that $I$ is a unit.
	Hence, the claim.
\end{proof} 



The terminology for normal, positive and unitary elements of a $C^\ast$-algebra 
comes from the corresponding concepts when studying operator algebras. 
Paul Dirac's \emph{`Principles of Quantum Mechanics'} \cite{dirac} and von 
Neumann's \emph{`Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics'} 
\cite{vonneumann32} jointly established a formulation of Quantum Mechanics in 
terms of Hilbert spaces, and operators thereon. To summarise briefly, a physical 
quantity in a quantum mechanical system has associated with it a self-adjoint 
operator $T$ on a Hilbert space $\H$,  while the state of the system corresponds 
to a unit vector $\phi$ in $\H$. Then the expected outcome of measuring the 
quantity corresponding to $T$ is given by evaluating $\langle\phi, 
T\phi\rangle$. In the context of $C^\ast$-algebras, these translate, in turn, to 
a self adjoint element $a$ of a $C^\ast$-algebra $A$, a normalised positive 
linear functional $\rho$ (that is, a state) on $A$, and evaluation of $\rho(a)$.


After stating his postulate, which he refers to as `\textbf{P.}', on the 
expectation value of a system of observables 
$\mathscr{R_1},\dots,\mathscr{R_\ell}$ with corresponding operators $R_1,\dots, 
R_\ell$, von Neumann makes a comment on a consequence in the model of the 
non-commutativity of operators on a Hilbert space:
\textquote[{\cite[p.~211]{vonneumann32}}]{In the case of noncommuting 
$R_1,\dots, R_\ell$, [...] \textbf{P.} gave no information regarding the 
probability relations of $\mathscr{R_1},\dots,\mathscr{R_\ell}$. In this case, 
\textbf{P.} could be used only determine the probability distribution of each of 
these quantities by itself, without consideration of the others.}

\chapter{Representations of $C^\ast$-Algebras}
\section{Abelian $C^\ast$-Algebras}\label{section:abelian}


Let $A$ be an Abelian $C^\ast$-algebra. For $a$ in $A$, define a complex-valued 
function $\hat{a}$ on $\P{A}$ by $\hat{a}(\rho)= \rho(a)$ -- that is, 
\emph{evaluation} at $a$. The weak$^\ast$-topology is the weakest topology on 
$\P{A}$ for which all of the maps $\hat{a}$ are continuous, so that $\hat{a} \in 
C(\P{A})$ for all $a\in A$. The map
\begin{align*}
	\Gamma:A \to C(\P{A}) : a\mapsto \hat{a}
\end{align*}
is called the \emph{Gelfand transform} on $A$ \cite{davidson96}.
For $a,b \in A$, $\alpha,\beta\in\C$ and $\rho\in\P{A}$:
\begin{align*}
		\widehat{(\alpha a+\beta b)}(\rho) = \rho(\alpha a+\beta b) 
	&=	\alpha\rho(a) +\beta\rho(b) = \alpha\hat{a}(\rho)+ \beta\hat{b}(\rho), 			\\
		\widehat{a^\ast}(\rho) = \rho(a^\ast) 
	&= \overline{\rho(a)} = \overline{\hat{a}(\rho)}.
\end{align*}
Since pure states are multiplicative by Proposition \ref{prop:puremult}, we have that 
\begin{align*}
	\widehat{(ab)} (\rho)= \rho(ab) = \rho(a)\rho(b) = \hat{a}(\rho)\hat{b}(\rho).
\end{align*}
Hence the Gelfand transform is a $\ast$-homomorphism, and the image $\Gamma(A)$ 
is a $C^\ast$-subalgebra of $C(\P A)$. The following theorem gives us $\Gamma$ 
is in fact a $\ast$-isomorphism.


\begin{thm}[{Gelfand-Naimark, commutative \cite[4.4.3]{kadison83}}] \label{thm:gnc}
	Every Abelian $C^\ast$-algebra $A$ is $\ast$-isomorphic to $C(\P A)$, the 
	algebra of continuous functions on the compact Hausdorff space $\P A$ of pure 
	states on $A$.

\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
	Since $A$ is Abelian, every $a$ in $A$ is normal, so by Lemma \ref{lemma:pure2} 
	there is a pure state $\rho_0$ on $A$ such that $|\rho_0(a)|=\left\|a\right\|$. 
	From this, 
	\begin{align*}
		\left\|a\right\|	=|\hat a(\rho_0)|\leq \sup_{\rho\in\P A}|\hat a(\rho)| 
							\leq \left\|a\right\|,
	\end{align*}
	so 
	\begin{align*}
		\left\|a\right\|=\sup_{\rho\in\P A} |\hat a (\rho)| = \left\|\hat a\right\|.
	\end{align*}
	Hence $\Gamma$ is isometric.
	Given any pure state $\rho$, $\hat \1(\rho) = \rho(\1) = 1$ (where $\1$ is the 
	identity of $A$), so $\hat\1$ is the constant function equal to $1$ on $\P A$ 
	and thus the unit in $C(\P A)$. Given distinct pure states $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$ 
	on $A$, we can choose $a$ in $A$ such that 
	\begin{align*}
		\hat a(\rho_1) = \rho_1(a) \not= \rho_2(a) = \hat a(\rho_2),
	\end{align*}
	so the image $\Gamma(A)$ separates points of $\P A$, and so by the 
	Stone-Weierstrass theorem (see Section \ref{section:CX}), $\Gamma(A)=C(\P A)$.

\end{proof}

This theorem allows us to think of the study of $C^\ast$-algebras in general as 
a sort of non-commutative topology; the `topological space' corresponds to the 
pure state space on a $C^\ast$-algebra $A$, and the `topology' corresponds to 
the preimages of the `evaluation at $a$' maps on states in the pure state space.



	
\section{The Gelfand-Naimark-Segal Construction}
In this section, we show that corresponding to every state of a 
$C^\ast$-algebra, there is a $\ast$-homomorphism into the operator algebra 
$\B(\H)$ on some Hilbert space $\H$. 


\begin{defn}
	Given a $C^\ast$-algebra $A$, a \emph{representation of $A$ on a Hilbert space 
	$\H$} is a $\ast$-homomorphism $\phi: A \to \BH$. A $\ast$-isomorphic 
	representation is called \emph{faithful}. If there exists an element $x\in\H$ 
	such that the set $\left\{\phi(a)x \mid a\in A\right\}$ is dense in $\H$, say 
	that $\phi$ is a \emph{cyclic} representation, with \emph{cyclic vector} $x$.

\end{defn}	
The construction used in the proof of this theorem is known as the 
Gelfand-Naimark-Segal (GNS) construction.
\begin{thm}[{\cite[4.5.2]{kadison83}}]\label{thm:gns}
	If $\rho$ is a state on a $C^\ast$-algebra $A$, then there exists a cyclic 
	representation $\pi_\rho$ of $A$ on a Hilbert space ${H}_\rho$, with unit cyclic 
	vector $x_\rho$, such that 
	\begin{align*} 
		\rho(a)= \langle \pi_\rho (a) x_\rho, x_\rho \rangle, ~~~~ \forall a \in A.
	\end{align*}
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
	We will construct from $\rho$ the space $\Hr$, representation $\pi_\rho$, and 
	vector $x_\rho$, and demonstrate the required properties.
	
	Consider the \emph{left kernel} of $\rho$:
	\begin{align*}
		L_\rho = \left\{a \in A \mid \rho (a ^\ast a) = 0 \right\}.
	\end{align*}	
	For $a,b \in A$, define $\langle a , b \rangle_0 = \rho(b^\ast a)$, then 
	$\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle_0$ satisfies
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item Linearity in 1st argument: for $a,b\in A$, $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{C}$:
		\begin{align*}
		   \langle \alpha a + \beta b, c \rangle_0 
		&= \rho (c^\ast(\alpha a + \beta b)   											\\
		&= \rho (\alpha c^\ast a + \beta c^\ast b)  									\\
		&= \alpha \rho (c^\ast a) + \beta \rho (c^\ast b)								\\
		&= \alpha \langle a , c \rangle_0 + \beta \langle b, c \rangle_0.
		\end{align*}
	  \item Conjugate symmetric: for $a,b \in A$:
	  	\begin{align*}
	  	   \langle b,a \rangle _0 
	  	&= \rho (a^\ast b)																\\
	  	&= \rho ((b^\ast a)^\ast)														\\
	  	&= \overline{\rho (b^\ast a)}													\\
	  	&= \overline{\langle a,b \rangle _0 }.
	  	\end{align*}
	  \item Positive semi-definite: for $a \in A$:
	  	\begin{align*}
	  	&=	\langle a,a\rangle_0 = \rho(a^\ast a) \geq 0,
	  	\end{align*}
	  	since $a^\ast a$ is positive for all $a$.
	\end{enumerate}
	Note that $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$ is not necessarily positive definite on 
	$A$ -- the left kernel is exactly where this fails.
	
	To see that $L_\rho$ is a linear subspace of $A$, consider 
	\begin{align*}
		L= \left\{t \in A  \mid \langle t,a \rangle _0 = 0,
				~\forall a \in A \right\} \subseteq L_\rho.
	\end{align*}
	For $t \in L_\rho$, by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality we have 
	\begin{align*} 
		|\langle t,a \rangle_0|^2 \leq \langle t,t \rangle_0 \langle a,a\rangle_0,
				~ \forall a \in A;
	\end{align*}
	that is,
	\begin{align*}
		\langle t,a \rangle _0 = 0, ~~~ \forall a \in A,
	\end{align*}
	so $t\in L$ and $L_\rho =L$.
	Now, for $a,b \in L$, $\alpha \in \mathbb{C}$ and $c \in A$:
	\begin{align*}
		\langle \alpha a + b, c \rangle _0 = \alpha \langle a,c \rangle _0 + 
						\langle b,c\rangle _0 = 0,
	\end{align*}
	so $\alpha a +b \in L$; also, $\langle 0,c\rangle _0 = 0$ so $0 \in L$. 
	Hence, $L_\rho  $ is a linear subspace of $A$.
	
	For $s \in A$, $t\in L_\rho$, by the Cauchy Schwarz inequality we have 
	\begin{align*}
		|\rho (s^\ast t) |^2 	
		&= 		|\langle t,s\rangle_0 |^2 												\\
		&\leq 	\langle t,t\rangle_0 \cdot \langle s,s\rangle_0  						\\
		&= 		\rho (t^\ast t) \cdot \rho (s^\ast s)									\\
		&=		0,
	\end{align*}
	so $\rho (s^\ast t) = 0$. Letting $s = a^\ast a t$ for $a \in A$, then
	\begin{align*}
		\rho ((at)^\ast at) 
		&= 		\rho (at^\ast a^\ast at) 												\\
		&= 		\rho ((a^\ast at)^\ast t) 												\\
		&= 		\rho (s^\ast t) 														\\
		&=		0,
	\end{align*}
	so that $at \in L_\rho$, for all $a \in A$ and $t \in L_\rho$; we conclude that 
	$L_\rho$ is a left ideal in $A$. $L_\rho$ is closed as the preimage in $A$ of 
	$\left\{0\right\}$ under the continuous map $a \mapsto \rho (a^\ast a)$. 

	
	Consider now the quotient space $V_\rho = A / L_\rho$, with $\langle 
	\cdot,\cdot\rangle$ defined by
	\begin{align*}
		\langle a+L_\rho,b+L_\rho \rangle = \langle a,b\rangle_0, ~~~~ 
		\mbox{for}~~a+L_\rho,b+L_\rho \in V_\rho.
	\end{align*}
	It follows from properties $i),~ii)$ and $iii)$ of $\langle \cdot,\cdot  \rangle 
	_0$ that $\langle \cdot,\cdot  \rangle$ is an inner product on $V_\rho$, with
	\begin{align*}
				\langle a + L^\rho, a + L^\rho \rangle = 0
		&\iff 	\langle a,a\rangle_0=0													\\
		&\iff 	a \in L_\rho															\\
		&\iff 	a+L_\rho = 0+L_\rho
	\end{align*}
	giving positive definiteness.
	The completion of $V_\rho$, with respect to the norm $\left\|\cdot\right\|$ 
	induced by $\langle\cdot,\cdot \rangle$, is a Hilbert space -- this is the 
	Hilbert space $\Hr$ we're looking for.

	Now we fix $a \in A$, and consider the map 
	\begin{align*}
		\pi_a : V_\rho \to V_\rho; b+L_\rho \mapsto ab+L_\rho.
	\end{align*}
	Let $b_1, b_2 \in A$ be such that $b_1+L_\rho = b_2+L_\rho$. Then:
	\begin{align*}
		&~~~~~~~~	b_1-b_2 \in L_\rho													\\	
		&\implies	a(b_1-b_2) \in L_\rho												\\	
		&\implies	ab_1-ab_2 \in L_\rho												\\	
		&\implies	ab_1 + L_\rho = ab_2+L_\rho											\\	
		&\implies	\pi_a(b_1+L_\rho) = \pi_a(b_2+L_\rho).
	\end{align*}
	Hence $\pi_a$ defines a linear operator on $V_\rho$.
	For $b+L_\rho \in V_\rho$:
	\begin{align*}
				\left\|a\right\|^2 \cdot \left\|b+L_\rho\right\| 
									- \left\| \pi_a(b+L_\rho) \right\|
		&=		\left\|a\right\|^2 \cdot \left\|b+L_\rho\right\| 
									- \left\| ab+L_\rho \right\|						\\
		&=		\left\|a\right\|^2 \cdot \langle b+L_\rho,b+L_\rho \rangle 
									- \langle ab+L_\rho,ab+L_\rho \rangle				\\
		&=		\left\|a\right\|^2 \cdot \rho(b^\ast b) - \rho ((ab)^\ast ab)			\\
		&= 		\rho (\left\|a\right\|^2 b^\ast b-b^\ast a^\ast ab)						\\
		&=		\rho (b^\ast (\left\|a\right\|^{2} \mathbbm{1} - a ^\ast a)b)			\\
		&\geq 	0.
	\end{align*}
	Thus $\pi_a$ is a bounded operator on $\Vr$, with $\left\|\pi_a\right\| \leq 
	\left\|a\right\|$. By continuity, $\pi_a$ extends to a bounded operator 
	$\pi_\rho(a):\Hr \to \Hr$, such that 
	\begin{align*} 
		\pi_\rho(a)(v) = \pi_a(v) 
	\end{align*} 
	for $v\in \Vr$. 
	Then $\pi_\rho(a) \in \B(\Hr)$ for each $a \in A$, so $\pi_\rho$ defines a map 
	$A \to \B(\Hr)$ such that $ a \mapsto \pi_\rho(a)$. This will be our 
	representation.

	
	Now, for $a,b \in A$, $c+ L_\rho \in \Vr$ and $\alpha \in \mathbb{C}$:
	\begin{align*}
				\pi_{\alpha a+b}(c+\Lr)
		&=		(\alpha a+b) (c+\Lr)													\\
		&=		(\alpha ac +\Lr) + (bc+\Lr)												\\
		&=		\alpha \pi_a (c+\Lr) + \pi_b(c+\Lr),
	\end{align*}
	so that $\pi_{\alpha a + b} = \alpha \pi_a +\pi_b$ on $\Vr$.
	
	For $a,b \in A$ and $c+ L_\rho \in \Vr$:
	\begin{align*}
		\pi_{ab}(c+\Lr)
		&=		abc+\Lr																	\\
		&=		\pi_a (bc+\Lr)															\\
		&=		\pi_a (\pi_b (c+\Lr))													\\
		&=		(\pi_a \cdot \pi_b) (c+\Lr),
	\end{align*}
	so that $\pi_{a b} = \pi_a \cdot \pi_b$ on $\Vr$.
	
	For $a\in A$ and $b+ L_\rho,~c+ L_\rho \in \Vr$:
	\begin{align*}
				\langle b+\Lr, \pi_a^\ast (c+\Lr) \rangle 
		&=		\langle \pi_a (b+\Lr), c+\Lr \rangle									\\
		&=		\langle ab +Lr, c+\Lr \rangle											\\
		&=		\rho(c^\ast ab)															\\
		&=		\rho((a^\ast c)^\ast b)													\\
		&=		\langle b+\Lr, a^\ast c+\Lr \rangle										\\
		&=		\langle b+\Lr, \pi_{a^\ast}(c+\Lr)\rangle,
	\end{align*}
	so that $ \pi_a^\ast = \pi_{a^\ast}$ on $\Vr$.
	
	The subset $\Vr$ is dense in $\Hr$, so the three properties above hold on $\Hr$ 
	by continuity of $\pi_\rho$. Hence, $\pi_\rho: A \to \B(\Hr)$ is a 
	representation of $A$. As to the unit vector, consider $\xr = \1 + \Lr \in \Vr$. 
	Then for $a \in A$,
	\begin{align*}
				\langle \pi_\rho(a)\xr ,\xr \rangle 
		&=		\langle \pi_a(\1+\Lr), \1+\Lr \rangle									\\
		&=		\langle a+\Lr, \1+\Lr \rangle											\\
		&=		\rho(a);
	\end{align*}
	and in particular, $\langle \xr,\xr \rangle = \rho (\1) = 1$, so $\xr$ is a unit 
	vector in $\Hr$. The set $\left\{\pi_\rho(a)x_\rho \mid a\in A\right\}$ is the 
	dense subset $\Vr$ of $\Hr$, so $x_\rho$ is a cyclic vector for $\rho$.


\end{proof}

We know from Section \ref{section:CX} that all functionals of the form 
$\rho_x(f) = f(x)$, for $x$ in $X$, are pure states on the $C^\ast$-algebra 
$\CX$. So, what happens if we apply the GNS construction to $\rho_x$?


Fix $x$ in $X$. If $\rho_x(\bar f f)=0$, then $(\bar f f)(x)=0$ and $f(x)=0$. 
Then the left kernel$L_{\rho_x}$ reduces to the kernel (in the usual linear 
sense) of $\rho_x$:
\begin{align*}
	L_{\rho_x} = \left\{f\in\CX \mid f(x) = 0\right\} = \ker(\rho_x).
\end{align*}
The kernel of a non-zero linear functional is a proper ideal, with codimension 
$1$, so when we take the quotient we find that 
\begin{align*}
	V_{\rho_x} = \CX/L_{\rho_x} \cong \C,
\end{align*}
which we identify with $\C$ in the natural way: $f+L_{\rho_x} \mapsto f(x)$.
Then for $g$ in $\CX$, the map 
\begin{align*}
	\pi_g:\C\to\C:z\mapsto g(x)z
\end{align*} 
is a linear operator on $\C$, and the map 
\begin{align*}
	\pi_{\rho_x}:\CX\to\B(\C):g\mapsto\pi_g
\end{align*} 
is a representation of $\CX$ on $\C$. The unit in $\CX$ is the constant function 
$\1$, which in $V_{\rho_x}$ is identified with $\1(x)=1$; so we have that $1$ is 
a cyclic vector for the representation $\pi_{\rho_x}$.

\section{The Gelfand-Naimark Theorem}\label{section:gn}
We finish this chapter with the big result; that every $C^\ast$-algebra can be 
isometrically embedded as a $C^\ast$-subalgebra of $\BH$, the $C^\ast$-algebra 
of bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space $\H$. First, we need another 
definition.

\begin{defn}
	Let $A$ be a $C^\ast$-algebra. Suppose we have a collection $\left\{\phi_i \mid 
	i\in I\right\}$ of representations of $A$ on Hilbert spaces $\left\{\H_i \mid 
	i\in I\right\}$. For $a$ in $A$, we have $\left\|\phi_i(a)\right\| \leq 
	\left\|a\right\|$ (by Proposition \ref{prop:homo}, as each $\phi_i$ is a 
	$\ast$-homomorphism), so we have a bounded operator $\oplus\phi_i(a)$ on $\oplus 
	\H_i$ by section \ref{section:hscons}. By the properties of $\oplus\phi_i(a)$ 
	stated therein, the map
	\begin{align*}
		\phi:A\to \B(\oplus\H_i):a\mapsto\oplus\phi_i(a)
	\end{align*}
	is a $\ast$-homomorphism, and so is a representation of $A$ on $\oplus\H_i$. 
	Call $\phi$ the \emph{direct sum} of the collection $\left\{\phi_i \mid i\in 
	I\right\}$, denoted $\oplus\phi_i$.

\end{defn}


\begin{thm}[Gelfand-Naimark, {\cite[4.5.6]{kadison83}}] \label{thm:gn}
	Every $C^\ast$-algebra has a faithful representation.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
	With $\S_0$ any collection of states on $A$ containing $\P{A}$, let $\phi$ be 
	the direct sum ofthe collection $\left\{\pi_\rho \mid \rho\in\S_0\right\}$ of 
	representations as constructed by the GNSconstruction. We will show that $\phi$ 
	is a faithful representation.

	
	Given $a$ in $A$, if $\phi(a)=0$ then $\pi_\rho(a)=0$ for all pure states $\rho$ 
	on $A$. But then,since $\rho(a)=\langle \pi_\rho (a) x_\rho, x_\rho \rangle$ by 
	the GNS construction, we have $\rho(a)=0$, and then by Lemma \ref{lemma:pure1}, 
	$a=0$. Thus, $\phi$ is one-to-one and hence a faithful representation of $A$.

\end{proof}

Note that the proof of the Gelfand-Naimark theorem depends on a choice of the 
set $\S_0$ of states on $A$, with the only restriction being that it contains 
the set of pure states $\P A$. If we take the direct sum over the 
representations associated with all of $\S (A)$, then $\phi$ is called \emph{the 
universal representation} of $A$.
